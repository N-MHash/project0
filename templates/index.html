  <p>Lucid dreaming is your chance to play around with the extraordinary abilities
    buried in unused parts of your brain. Regardless of whether your are
    superhuman in real life or not, lucid dreaming is a way for you to put the
    deepest areas of your brain to good use while you’re sleeping. You can be a
    Jane Doe while awake and superman while sleeping. All the obstacles of reality
    can be set aside, as you make trips to the sun or the interior of the earth or
    test your craziest science experiments on your worst enemies.</p>

  <p>Lucid dream researcher Beverly D'Urso knows everything about lucid dreaming:
    She has been a lucid dreamer since she was seven years old. She has worked
    with psychophysiologist Stephen Laberge, the founder of the Lucidity
    Institute. She was the first person to have a recorded orgasm during a dream.
    During her lucid dreams, she has tasted fire, visited the sun and overcome a
    writer's block. She has done it all. We recently conducted an interview with
    the lucid dream expert.</p>

  <h5>What does "lucid dreaming" mean?</h5>

  <p>Even though the term "lucid" means clear, lucid dreaming is more than just
     having a clear dream. To have a lucid dream you must know that it’s a dream
     while you’re dreaming. That's it. It doesn't require that you can control
     anything in your dream, though control is what beginning lucid dreamers
     often aim at. People get attracted to lucid dreaming because they want to be
     able to do things they could never do in waking reality, for example, taste
     fire or fly to the sun. More and more experienced lucid dreamers are
     realizing the benefits of lucid dreaming. You can use it to explore the
     boundaries of your own agency and the limits of the universe.</p>
