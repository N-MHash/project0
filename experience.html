            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 26th of August in 2016. I fell in love. And that night, I died.*</em></strong></p>
            <p>I had a dream last night. So real that it completely blurred the lines between sleeping and waking life. So real that waking up this morning left me disoriented, and after a brief moment, crushed. I had been given an alternate reality, one that I would have chosen to continue instead of the life I woke to. But now, awake, that reality has been taken away.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 2nd of September in 2012. I mastered telekinesis, picking up small objects around the room with nothing but my mind. It was exhilarating. That night, I died.*</em></strong></p>
            <p>The beauty of dreams is that they're far more than just visions. They don&rsquo;t just engage the eyes; they engage the mind. You see, smell, hear, taste, and feel. You exist. These dreams, they&rsquo;re miniature replicas, living microcosms of a larger existence. And while the dreams may be yours, the existence within them is not. You are no god, no architect. No sculptor of imagination. It is your imagination that creates the world, but not at your hands. In sleep, you are victim to your imagination as much as any other entity.</p>
            <p>You&rsquo;re not alone in your dreams. You are joined by Others. Who are they? Family. Friends. Enemies. Lovers. People both real and imaginary. Figments of memory, fleeting faces, subconscious thoughts given life and character. And in your dreams, these others live, love, fail and fall, whether you want them to or not. Just like you. You join them not as the all-powerful owner of the world-shaping imagination, but as one of them: limited, blind, frail, and subject to the rules that define your current microcosmic existence.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 7th of May in 2015. You invited me to your house, although I couldn&rsquo;t understand why. You had never done anything for me but use me to get your way. It felt nice to finally be acknowledged. That night, I died.*</em></strong></p>
            <p>In the real world, when you talk to someone, you are talking to an external entity. In the dream world, when you talk to someone, you are talking to yourself. You are talking to your own subconscious, given form and life. In nightmares, you are chased by your subconscious fears. When you fly, you indulge a subconscious longing for abilities beyond your natural own. When you interact with anyone in a dream, you are sharing a moment of conscious existence with your subconscious self.</p>
            <p>How many times have you lived a life that was impossible to achieve in the real world? A new job, a zombie apocalypse, a party with friends you've never met, a new love, a huge fight, an emotionally uplifting or draining experience. You didn't just watch it happen. You saw, smelled, heard, tasted, and felt it. You lived it. Are these experiences any less valuable than those that we are submitted to in our conscious moments? Yes, a few of the fundamental rules of existence bend. So what? So what if gravity occasionally lets go of us, or situations that could never be explained by science take place? If tomorrow in your 'real' waking life you discovered that you could fly, would that mean that any lessons or experiences you've had so far would suddenly lose their value?</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 17th of March in 2011. The cold was all around me, and my rapid breaths came out in small clouds of white steam. I was careful not to make any sudden movements or give away my position, only allowing myself the slightest shifts from my prone position in the snow. The sniper in front of me seemed hungry, and I, eager to feed it. I held my breath, looked through the scope, and pulled the trigger. That night, I died.*</em></strong></p>
            <p>Life... continues. Day after day, we wake up in the same bed that we slept in the day before. We go to the job we applied to many months ago. We remain attached to the person we chose to be with years ago. Every day, we carry the luggage, experience, and decisions of every past day we have lived. Sleep interrupts wakefulness, but it does not disrupt it. It is this growing pool of experience that we have chosen to call, simply, life. We each have one life, we say, because nobody can fully run away from all of their responsibilities, their name, their past and who they are. If your life reset every time you slept, you would no longer have one 80-year life- you would have tens of thousands of lives, each one lasting only sixteen to nineteen hours on average.</p>
            <p>What about the time that passes outside of these sixteen to nineteen hours? The time we sleep, and retreat from our responsibilities? The mind does not enter a catatonic state, inactive until &lsquo;life&rsquo; resumes. It continues to live, in dreams, and is unable to perceive the differences between waking and sleeping life. Only when we wake up do we think &ldquo;ah, none of that really happened&rdquo;. But it did. You felt that fear, that pain, that heartbreak. It just happened when you weren&rsquo;t awake, and you chose to discard it, to somehow judge the experience as fake or unreal.</p>
            <p>But was it?</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 26th of November in 2013. I arrived at the house, anxious to get out of the cold and join my friends inside. They greeted me at the door, and guided me to the living room. I quickly glanced around. A warm orange glow infused the room from the lamps above, illuminating a joyous scene around a small coffee table. The couches were almost all fully occupied, leaving only a space next to you. Next to You. You, with your long, straight blonde hair, infectious smile, and ugly sweater. You, somehow laughing and smiling at both me and a friend&rsquo;s joke simultaneously. We fell in love later that evening. And that night, I died.*</em></strong></p>
            <p>Maybe we don't just get one life. Maybe we get one long, continuous existence that spans decades, and tens of thousands of smaller, shorter ones.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>*I was born on the 10th of November in 1988. I was raised by conservative religious parents in San Jose, California. I moved to Singapore when I was 5, and Cambodia when I turned 11. I wasn't very popular in school. I was never bullied, but usually ended up being picked close to last for class activities. That all changed when I went to college. I made acquaintances, a few life-long friends, and found love. I found my self-confidence, began teaching, writing. Developed. Matured. Aged. I lived a good life, all things considered. Now, in bed, I'm alone. I've already said goodbye, had my last human contact. I look at the monitor in front of me, but my mind is elsewhere. It's with you, friends, loves, family. I close my eyes, like I have so many times before. It's a familiar feeling. I let go. And tonight, I die.*</em></strong></p>
